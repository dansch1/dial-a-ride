A java implementation of Harilaos N. Psaraftis dynamic programming solution
to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (static case only).

Key bindings:
f1 - Toggle GUI
f2 - Zoom and center the map to a best fit around the waypoints (There is currently a bug in the JXMapViewer2 library
								 that will cause an AIOOBE if the points are really close together)

Map tiles and files for routing can be found here:
